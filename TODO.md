TODO list
==========


- add a version to the library and executable
- what to do with `overlearn` which is not used?
- check consistency of params, 
  *  e.g. elite_size <= pop_size
  * not all metrics weights are 0
- Scalar::print(), used by NamedList::print() use StringUtils::prettyDistinguishableDoubleToString() that loses a lot of precision...
